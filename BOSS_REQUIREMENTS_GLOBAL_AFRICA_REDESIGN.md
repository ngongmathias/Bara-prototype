# Boss Requirements - Global Africa & Countries Redesign

**Date:** December 8, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Theme:** Black & White, Clean, Sophisticated

---

## 🎯 Main Objective
Unify "Countries" and "Global Africa" sections into one cohesive "BARA GLOBAL" section with consistent layout and styling.

---

## ✅ TODO List

### 1. **Merge Countries & Global Africa into "BARA GLOBAL"**
- [ ] Remove separate "Countries" and "Global Africa" sections
- [ ] Create unified "BARA GLOBAL" section
- [ ] Mix all entries together (countries + diaspora communities)
- [ ] Update navigation to show "BARA GLOBAL" instead of "Countries"
- [ ] Add subtitle: "Explore Global Africa"

### 2. **Standardize Layout - Use COUNTRIES Format**
- [ ] Apply the clean boxed layout from COUNTRIES page to ALL Global Africa entries
- [ ] Use orderly segmented boxes (same as countries)
- [ ] Ensure Global Africa entries (African Americans, HBCUs, etc.) match the country page format
- [ ] Include sections like:
  - Demographics
  - Economic Profile
  - Population stats
  - Consumer spending
  - Median household income
  - Homeownership rates
  - Business ownership
  - Life expectancy
  - Voter turnout (if applicable)
  - College graduates
  - Cultural impact
- [ ] Add relevant sections from country layouts where applicable
- [ ] Skip non-applicable sections (e.g., voter turnout for non-US entries)
- **NOTE:** Boss wants Global Africa pages to look like Country pages, not the other way around

### 3. **Verify Flags on ALL Entries**
- [ ] Check if countries page already has flags
- [ ] If yes, ensure consistency across all entries
- [ ] If no, add flags to all entries:
  - Benin, Botswana, Cape Verde, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Seychelles
  - Jamaica, Haiti, Trinidad, Brazil
  - African Americans (US flag)
  - HBCUs (US flag)
- **NOTE:** Countries page may already have flags - verify first before making changes

### 4. **HBCUs Section Improvements**
- [ ] Change "Top HBCUs by Reputation" to just "HBCUs"
- [ ] Make it a scrollable list showing ALL universities
- [ ] Sort alphabetically instead of by reputation
- [ ] **CHALLENGE:** Make university names clickable with external links
  - Need to investigate: Can we add hyperlinks in the admin panel when entering data?
  - Or do we need to create a separate HBCUs database table with URL field?
  - Or use markdown/rich text in description field?
  - Links should open in NEW WINDOW (target="_blank")
  - Link to actual university websites:
    - Spelman University → https://www.spelman.edu
    - Howard University → https://www.howard.edu
    - Xavier University → https://www.xula.edu
    - Hampton University → https://www.hamptonu.edu
    - Tuskegee University → https://www.tuskegee.edu
    - etc.
- **NOTE:** Need to determine technical approach for making text clickable within country-format layout

### 5. **Black & White Theme Throughout Website**
- [ ] Remove ALL orange highlights
- [ ] Apply black and white color scheme consistently
- [ ] Match the new homepage design (clean, sophisticated)
- [ ] Remove colorful elements
- [ ] Use black text on white backgrounds
- [ ] Use white text on black backgrounds for contrast

### 6. **Remove Large Top Hero Banners**
- [ ] NO big top picture banners (elephants, Savannah, etc.)
- [ ] Remove large hero images from country/global pages
- [ ] Keep everything clean and minimal
- **NOTE:** This is about removing hero images, NOT touching the current banner ads system
- **DO NOT CHANGE:** Current banner ad system stays as is

## 📋 Key Design Principles

1. **Clean & Sophisticated** - No clutter, orderly boxes
2. **Black & White Only** - Remove all color highlights
3. **Consistent Layout** - Same structure for all entries
4. **Flags for All** - Every entry gets its flag
5. **External Links** - Open in new windows
6. **Unified Section** - One "BARA GLOBAL" instead of two separate sections

---

## 🎨 Reference Pages

**Good Examples to Follow:**
- African Americans page layout ✅
- HBCUs page layout ✅
- New homepage design ✅

**Apply This Style To:**
- All country pages
- All diaspora community pages
- All Global Africa entries

---

## 📝 Notes

- Some entries are actual countries (Jamaica, Haiti, Trinidad, Brazil)
- Some entries are diaspora communities (African Americans, Black Brazilians)
- Brazil entry focuses specifically on Black Brazilians
- African Americans entry focuses on Black American demographics
- Countries already created for Jamaica, Haiti, etc. in database
- Need to ensure layout consistency across ALL entries
